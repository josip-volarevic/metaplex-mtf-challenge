## üö© What is "Mint the Flag"?

‚ìÇÔ∏è Metaplex MTF Challenge

Idea: organize a few hours long "hackathon" inspired by the ["Capture the Flag"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)). Devs would clone our `metaplex/mtf-challenge` repository and start the challenge at the same time. The goal is to mint the Flag NFT from the Candy Machine. This is done by fixing the codebase within our MTF repo (e.g. replacing faulty `.getProgramAccounts()`) and adding new features like listening to a specific wallet via webhook. At some point hackers get their wallet allowlisted on the CM Program and are able to capture (mint) the flag.

**Number of Flags in the CM can vary depending on the number of participants*

**This can be turned into a quarterly "Metaplex MTF event" with different setup and prizes each time. Each with a focus on different part of the Metaplex stack (Bubblegum, Candy Machine v4, Auction House etc.)*

**Prizes could also be Helius API credits or something else unrelated to $MPLX tokens.*

## ü§î Why?

- Metaplex reputation should & could be improved, especially amongst devs

- Metaplex needs to preserve the dominance as the no.1 solution, it needs to marry devs to their solutions

- Metaplex can claim the throne as the biggest Maecena of open source


## ü§® How?

1. **Reputation**
- throw money at devs
- connect with the dev community
- *panem et circenses* - give them something to look forwards to


2. **Dominance**
- make devs invested in your solutions by having them spend time to learn your tech. The cost to migrate/learn a new solution is always the biggest one. Otherwise Svelte would win over React
- make devs invested in your ecosystem by giving them prizes in $MPLX


3. **Open source**
- keep everything open source
- reward open source contributions


## ü§ù What will we do?
- quarterly "Mint the Flag" competition
- 500+ participating developers per cohort
- biggest developer competition on Solana
- adoption of Metaplex solutions
- more Metaplex evangelists


## üí∞ What do we need?
- a chunky prize pool - 20,000 $MPLX every quarter
- social media exposure
- $10,000 grant
- some time to cook


## üìù Other notes
- Prior to each event a **workshop** or **AMA** could be held. For example, if the next competition is themed around the Candy Machine v4, we could do a CM v4 workshop a few days before. Workshop before the event itself would be a nice opportunity to see the community interest. If there are 50 attendees, we can expect 500 participants. These would also act as a nice opportunity to level the playing field for new devs which haven't laid their hands on Metaplex and/or CM v4 yet.

- **MTF Gitbook**: a simple gitbook with hints could be created in case someone is stuck on the challenege. This documentation would hold relevant code snippets, explanations, and hints.

- Additional development might be necessary to make the repository support both Windows and Linux through `cross-env` integration.
